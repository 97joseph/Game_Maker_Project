                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>While undercover, Perry can normally be found with his owners, Phineas and Ferb. As their pet, he lives up to the expectations for a platypus and "doesn't do much." Even though Candace would describe him as just a mindless, smelly animal, Perry still shows signs of intelligence when he's pretending to be a normal pet, so she may mean insane rather than dumb.</p>
                    <h3>Physical Appearance</h3>
                    <p>Perry is a greenish-teal platypus with yellow tinged tangerine webbing only on his back feet. He also has three dark hairs on his head, a low, long salmon-orange beaver tail, dark brown eyes in an unnatural wall-eyed position, making him look mindlessly stupid, and duck bill that matches his webbing color.</p>
                    <h3>Abilities and Equipment</h3>
                    <p>It is currently unknown how Perry was recruited into the Agency in the first place, nor what kind of training Perry has undergone before receiving missions.<br><b>The most frequent gadgets he uses are, </b></p>
                
                    <ul><li><b>Wrist communicator</b> - Perry wears a watch-like communicator on his front left paw, and one on his front right paw, although it could be the same watch. It is normally hidden by his fur.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li><b>Video communicator</b> - Agent P uses a PDA-like, video-chatting device to communicate with his headquarters. Dr. Doofenshmirtz once built a "Monster Truck Locate-inator" that looked the same as Agent P's communicator, just a different color.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li><b>Notepad and pencil</b> - Perry uses it to write down notes for his missions but where he has it while not using it is unknown. Perry has also been seen drawing Monogram on the notepad while being briefed for a mission.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li><b>Laptop</b> - Agent P has a teal laptop with a yellow footprint on the cover which he uses to tap into and reprogram the GPS system on the Flynn-Fletcher's rental recreational vehicle</li></ul>
